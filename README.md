# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study 
Problem Statement: - An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.

X Education faces a challenge in improving its lead conversion rate, which currently stands at around 30%. The company generates a substantial number of leads through various channels, including websites and search engines like Google. Once a lead fills out a form providing contact details, they are classified as a potential customer. However, despite acquiring many leads, the conversion process is inefficient, with a significant portion of leads failing to convert into paying customers. To address this, X Education seeks to identify the most promising leads, or "hot leads," to focus the sales team's efforts on those with the highest likelihood of converting, thereby improving the overall conversion rate. The company's target is to increase the conversion rate to around 80%.

The process of lead conversion can be visualized as a funnel. At the top of the funnel, there are a large number of leads, but as the process progresses, many of them drop off without converting. The key challenge lies in identifying and nurturing the leads in the middle of the funnel, increasing their likelihood of conversion. The goal is to build a model that assigns a lead score to each lead, where a higher score reflects a higher chance of conversion. The model's output, a lead score between 0 and 100, should help prioritize leads for follow-up by the sales team, with higher scores indicating "hot" leads and lower scores corresponding to "cold" leads.

To develop such a model, the first step is data preprocessing. The dataset provided includes several features, such as "Lead Source," "Total Time Spent on Website," "Total Visits," and "Last Activity," but also includes categorical variables with levels like 'Select,' which are effectively null values and need to be handled properly. This preprocessing step involves addressing missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for model training. Once the data is cleaned, the next step is feature selection, where the most relevant features are identified to ensure that the model is not influenced by irrelevant or highly correlated variables, which could lead to multicollinearity.

The model that best fits this task is logistic regression, as it is a binary classification algorithm and is capable of predicting probabilities. By training a logistic regression model on the dataset, we can predict the probability that each lead will convert, which serves as the basis for the lead score. The probabilities output by the model will reflect the likelihood of a lead converting, with higher probabilities indicating hotter leads. To prevent overfitting, techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization can be applied, which penalize large coefficients in the model, helping it generalize better to new data.

Once the logistic regression model is trained, the predicted probabilities can be scaled to generate a lead score between 0 and 100. This score will be used by the sales team to prioritize leads, focusing their efforts on those most likely to convert. The model should also be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the AUC-ROC curve, to assess how well it differentiates between converted and non-converted leads. Fine-tuning the model by adjusting the threshold for classifying leads as "hot" will help further optimize performance, ensuring that the highest-converting leads are targeted first.

Ultimately, the implementation of this model will allow X Education to significantly improve its lead conversion process by identifying leads that are more likely to convert into paying customers. This will not only increase the overall conversion rate but also ensure that the sales team is focusing on the most promising leads, thereby making their efforts more efficient and effective. By continuously monitoring and updating the model as new data becomes available, X Education can refine its lead scoring process and adapt to changing market conditions, ensuring sustained growth and improved conversion rates in the long term.
